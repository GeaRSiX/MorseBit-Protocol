Encrypting:
1. Find INDEX in morsecode_binarytree_lookup.txt
2. number1 = Divide INDEX by 2
3. number2 = Minus 1 from the number1
4. number3 = encrypted INDEX in morsecode_binarytree_lookup.txt

Decrypting:
1. number1 = encrypted INDEX in morsecode_binarytree_lookup.txt
2. number2 = Add 1 to number1
3. number3 = Times number2 by 2
4. Find number3 in morsecode_binarytree_lookup.txt
